### Strategy

#### Project Goals 
To provide orderly and relevant information about the developer and his work to potential employers, contractors and collaborators.

#### Developer Goals: 
To expose designing capabilities from the start. To showcase an attractive, well-designed resume website that evolves as time passes and experience cumulates.

### Scope 

#### Features
* The project is presented on a single page format with a practical fixed navigation menu.
* Fully responsive on different screen sizes.
* It counts with a contact form inside a modal pop-up.
* Download link for a PDF copy of the physical version of the developer's resume.

### Structure 

#### Information
 The content is grouped in 4 different sections
* About me: introduction, motivation, relevant personal info, education.
* Experience: timeline with a work history list.
* Skills: Progress bars with showcasing diverse skills grouped in 4 categories: Coding, Languages, IT and Culinary.

### Skeleton
For the wireframes, Figma software has been used to lay out the foundations of the website.

Check the wireframes here -- [Wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/GPEZVsOYZX8YZx683e31gn/MS1-v2?node-id=0%3A1&viewport=331%2C557%2C0.1710612028837204)

### Surface
 The website is focused on displaying only important information. The content is easy to navigate and is neatly divided in sections, with every section having a complete different design's structure, as to keep the user's attention.

 The colour palette was chosen with night/dark mode in mind. Potential users will be professionals of the field  that expend a lot of their time in front of screens. An easy to look at, not overly bright design is what was chosen for the project. 
* Two shades of grey for backgrounds. 
* Two shades of white for text.
* Two shades of yellow for details and effects.

The fonts are:
* Cinzel for headers. Uppercase and bold, is sure to catch the user's attention.
* Raleway for content. A more friendly approach for longer pieces of text.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I expect the purpose of the website to be explicit.

        *. Upon entering the site, the user will see the introductory text that presents the developer and a navigation bar so they can choose a section and start navigating through the website.
        *. The user has two options, click navigation bar buttons or scroll down, since it is a single page site.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I consider smooth navigation through content to be a key aspect.

        *. The header and navigation bar will stay fixed so the option of jumping to a different section is always available. The navigation bar that becomes a burger button on small screens, each link describes the section they will end up at clearly.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want for the content of the website to be relevant and concise. 
        *. The paragraphs are short and focused. No big pieces of text nor unnecessary information is being display.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I would like to see updated information about the developer's latest projects.

        *. Given that this is the first project, this goal should be considered into future features.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to have ease of access to contact the developer.

        *. Two buttons in the page will pop-up a modal form for the user to contact the developer. "Contact" button in the navigation bar, and "Work with me" in the footer.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check which resources and elements have been used for new projects.

        *. Given that this is the first project, this goal should be considered into future features.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to propose new projects or ideas.

        *. The previously mentioned contact form counts with a textbox for users to suggest projects and ideas.
