## UX
 
 ### Strategy

 #### Project Goals 
 To provide orderly and relevant information about the developer and his work to potential employers, contractors and collaborators.
 
 #### Developer Goals: 
 To expose designing capabilities from the start. To showcase an attractive, well-designed resume website that evolves as time passes and experience cumulates.

### Scope 

#### Features
* The project is presented on a single page format with a practical fixed navigation menu.
* Fully responsive on different screen sizes.
* It counts with a contact form inside a modal pop-up.
* Download link for a PDF copy of the physical version of the developer's resume.

### Structure 

#### Information
 The content is grouped in 4 different sections
* About me: introduction, motivation, relevant personal info, education.
* Experience: timeline with a work history list.
* Skills: Progress bars with showcasing diverse skills grouped in 4 categories: Coding, Languages, IT and Culinary.

### Skeleton
For the wireframes, Figma software has been used to lay out the foundations of the website.

[Wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/GPEZVsOYZX8YZx683e31gn/MS1-v2?node-id=0%3A1&viewport=331%2C557%2C0.1710612028837204)

### Surface
 The website is focused on displaying only important information. The content is easy to navigate and is neatly divided in sections, with every section having a complete different design's structure, as to keep the user's attention.

 The colour palette was chosen with night/dark mode in mind. Potential users will be professionals of the field  that expend a lot of their time in front of screens. An easy to look at, not overly bright design is what was chosen for the project. 
* Two shades of grey for backgrounds. 
* Two shades of white for text.
* Two shades of yellow for details and effects.

The fonts are:
* Cinzel for headers. Uppercase and bold, is sure to catch the user's attention.
* Raleway for content. A more friendly approach for longer pieces of text.

## User stories
