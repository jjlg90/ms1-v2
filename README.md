# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project - JJLG

This project consists of an online resume, to become portfolio once the developer's start getting more experience on the development field and worked in new and original projects.
 
## UX
 
 ### Strategy

 #### Project Goals 
 To provide orderly and relevant information about the developer and his work to potential employers, contractors and collaborators.
 
 #### Developer Goals: 
 To expose designing capabilities from the start. To showcase an attractive, well design resume website that evolves as time passes and experience cumulates.

### Scope 

#### Features
* The project is presented on a single page format with a practical fixed navigation menu.
* Fully responsive on different screen sizes.
* It counts with a contact form inside a modal pop-up.
* Download link for a PDF copy of the physical version of the developer's resume.

### Structure 

#### Information
 The content is grouped in 4 different sections
* About me: introduction, motivation, relevant personal info, education.
* Experience: timeline with a work history list.
* Skills: Progress bars with showcasing diverse skills grouped in 4 categories: Coding, Languages, IT and Culinary.

### Skeleton
-insert wireframes here-

### Surface
 The website is focused on displaying only important information. The content is easy to navigate and is neatly divided in sections, with every section having a complete different desing structure, as to keep the user's attention.

 The color palette was chosen having in mind a night mode. Potential users will be professionals of the field  that expend a lot of their time in front of screens. An easy to look at, not overly bright design is what was chosen for the project. 
* Two shades of gray for backgrounds. 
* Two shades of white for text.
* Two shades of yellow for details and effects.

The fonts are:
* Cinzel for headers. Uppercase and bold, it's sure to catch the user's attention.
* Raleway for content. A more friendly approach for longer pieces of text.

## User stories

### First time visitor
* The purpose of the website should be explicit.
* Smooth navigation through content is key.
* The content of the website should be relevant and concise. 

### Returning visitor
* Would like to see updated information about the developer's latest projects.
* Ease of access to contact the developer.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
